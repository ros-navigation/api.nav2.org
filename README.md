# rosdox.nav2.org
Hosting rclcpp doxygen in more (subjectively) developer-friendly format.
I'm frustrated by the [new API doc format](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/p/rclcpp/generated/classrclcpp_1_1Node.html#classrclcpp_1_1Node) which I find utterly unreadable for C++'s verbose syntax.

Totally vibe-coded with Claude Code to the minimum degree required to function.
Read the source code and submit PRs at your own (sanity's) risk.
Contributions welcome, but manual testing is required.
The only changes made here are changes you submit yourself.
