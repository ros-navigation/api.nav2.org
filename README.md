Hosting rclcpp doxygen in more (subjectively) developer-friendly format.
I'm frustrated by the [new API doc format](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/p/rclcpp/generated/classrclcpp_1_1Node.html#classrclcpp_1_1Node) which Your Friendly Neighborhood Navigator finds unreadable for C++'s verbose syntax.
I don't think I'm alone in this, so I made this site to host the doxygen docs in a more readable format.

Totally vibe-coded with Claude Code to the minimum degree required to function.
Read the source code and submit PRs at your own (sanity's) risk.
Contributions welcome, but manual testing is required.
