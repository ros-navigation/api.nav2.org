# api.nav2.org

Hosting Nav2 & ROS 2 doxygen in a developer-friendly format.

Totally vibe-coded with Claude Code to the minimum degree required to function.
Read the source code and submit PRs at your own (sanity's) risk.
Contributions welcome, but manual testing is required.

## Updates Note

Make sure new messages are asked to have the result enums be in the description for ``error_codes``.

When updating, ask Claude to generate useage examples and extract the data from nav2_msgs to populate the descriptions.
