# rosdox.nav2.org
Hosting rclcpp doxygen in more (subjectively) developer-friendly format.
I'm frustrated by the [new API doc format](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/p/rclcpp) which I find utterly unreadable.

Totally vibe-coded with Claude Code to the minimum degree required to function.
Read the source code and submit PRs at your own (sanity's) risk.
